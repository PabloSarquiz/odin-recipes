    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Beef stew is a hearty, slow-cooked dish made by simmering chunks of beef with vegetables and flavorful seasonings until everything becomes tender and rich. It typically starts with beef chuck or another well-marbled cut, which is cut into cubes, seasoned with salt and pepper, and browned in a heavy pot to develop deep flavor. After browning, onions and garlic are sautéed in the same pot, followed by the addition of broth (often beef stock), and sometimes tomato paste or a splash of red wine for extra depth. Herbs like thyme, bay leaves, and rosemary are commonly added to build aroma.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Once the liquid is added, the stew is brought to a gentle simmer and cooked slowly for one to two hours. Root vegetables such as carrots and potatoes are added partway through cooking so they become tender without overcooking. As it simmers, the beef softens and the flavors meld together, creating a thick, comforting sauce. Some recipes thicken the stew with a flour slurry or by coating the beef in flour before browning. The finished dish is typically served hot, often with crusty bread to soak up the rich broth.</p>
